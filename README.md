hosted: https://lesmaterialen.rstudio.hu.nl/reproducible_research_workshop/

This repo atm contains a proposal for a halfday workshop on data management, in bookdown format.
This will be extended to the reader of the workshop in the near future.


## Workshop contents

 1. Practical Data Handling, folder structure, meta data and provenance
 1. Data sharing, sending others your data, receiving data, versioning
 
The workshop will be a very practical, hands-on exercise with the above topics. Learning outcomes will be directly applied to own data and workflows
Many of the concepts are derived from this booklet:

This can be a handy reference for after the workshop, but is not mandatory.
